 ### Form

A form component in React enables users to enter information or make selections, which can then be submitted for processing.

It typically consists of input fields, buttons, and sometimes validation logic.

### Event listener

In React, an event listener is a function that is attached to a JSX element using attributes like onClick, onChange, etc., to respond to user interactions with the component.
#### Example
< button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</ button>

In this example, onClick is the event listener that listens for a click event on the button element. When clicked, it calls the handleClick function.

### State 
State in React refers to the internal data held by a component, which can change over time in response to user actions or other events, triggering re-rendering of the component.
