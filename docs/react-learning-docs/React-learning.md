# React learning
## Introduction
## Libraries/Framework
#### Libraries

Collections of pre-written, reusable code modules that simplify and enhance software development.
#### Frameworks

Comprehensive, pre-established software structures that provide a foundation for building applications, enforcing a specific design and coding paradigm.

## Declarative/Imperative
Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do 
and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means we need
to tell it HOW to do each step.
## Composable
We have small pieces that we can put together to make something
larger/greater than the individual pieces.

## jsx
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows developers to write XML/HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to define and structure UI components.

## Custom Component
Custom components in React refer to user-defined, reusable building blocks created to encapsulate specific functionality or UI elements. 
##### React  Component:A function that returns React elements.

## Parent and Child Components


#### Parent Component:
Manages and contains one or more child components, passing data and behavior to them through props.

#### Child Component:
Receives and displays information from the parent, promoting a hierarchical structure in the application's UI.
